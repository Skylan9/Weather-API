# Weather-API

This is a project made based on the roadmap.sh project 'Weather-API'.

In this project the user can search for a city and can get information about the min,max and average temperature of that city for today and the upcoming 5 days. 

The aim of this project was to become familiar with several topics like Redis, Flask and environmental variables.
